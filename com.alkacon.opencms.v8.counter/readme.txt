1. Module functions

With the Counter module, it is possible to manage multiple counters which
can be used in many different ways on the website.

    * Usage examples are download numbers, page hits, a user poll or anything
	  else that requires a counter.
    * A new icon is added to the "Administration View"  in the "Database
      Management" screen which allows to easily manage the counters.
    * The individual counters are stored in a special database table which is
      created by the module.
    * There are also API options that allow to use the counters on templates
      or with other modules.
